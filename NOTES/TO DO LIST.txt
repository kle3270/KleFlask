1. Compartmentalize Login into different functions
2. Create main file which will call the server to run and when certain things happen it will run functions from login
3. Check if username exists for signup, rn focusing on getting login functionality
4. Figure out how to actually use classes right now im just gonna use the good ol list maybe dictionary
5. Redirect page instead of just doing a link.
6. Not actually posting so need to understand what post actually is. Its posting to /refreshingnotes/user but its getting from notes/s

8. Github
