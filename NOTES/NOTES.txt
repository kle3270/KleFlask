1. Use dynamically generated URLs  -> use objects to create a notepage for a name
2. When using integers need to do <int:____> and for other data types I guess you can also do <type:___> for the parameter of route
3.url_for --> this will be used to send a user to their web page and not somebody elses
4.render_template allows loading of files
5.request.form grabs all the information and post is used in html to put it on the page that I want the data to go
6. Attribute means two different things, in get attribute it gets the value but in hasattr it returns if the object has an attribute named 'x'

8. POST --> if it wants to put something on another page, it grabs the form info from the previous page and then sends it as data to the next
9. For some reason I send the data to post onto goto but maybe it cant also send that over to the next page
10. Because the method isnt post it isnt posting it over to the next page
